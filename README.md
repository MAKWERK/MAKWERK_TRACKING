Tracking data in R

Tracking data pre-processing done by Eliot McKinley - @etmckinley on Twitter

Included are a script with a brief intro to Tidyverse, but others have made much better intros than I ever will for example:

Overall the scripts are not optimized for speed or memory.

But rather written so that all steps are "readable" to people starting out.

Packages needed:
Tidyverse
grid
gridExtra
