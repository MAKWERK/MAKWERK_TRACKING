# MAKWERK_TRACKING
Tracking data in R:

Rather than look at a voronoi diagram the included script will set up a simple implementation of "Packing", a simple implementation of "Pressure" and futher analysis combining the two in time.

The definitions and usefullness of these metrics can be debated.

Tracking data pre-processing done by Eliot McKinley - @etmckinley on Twitter

Included are a script with a brief intro to Tidyverse, but others have made much better intros than I ever will for example:

Overall the scripts are not optimized for speed or memory - but rather written so that all steps are "readable" to people starting out.


Packages needed:

Tidyverse

grid

gridExtra

ggforce
